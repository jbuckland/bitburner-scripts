    Given the following array of array of numbers representing a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

    Example:
    
    [[1, 3], [8, 10], [2, 6], [10, 16]]
    
    would merge into [[1, 6], [8, 16]].
    
    The intervals must be returned in ASCENDING order. You can assume that in an interval, the first number will always be smaller than the second.
